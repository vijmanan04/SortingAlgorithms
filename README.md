# SortingExercise

This assignment is to review the 3 different sort algorithms, 

* Bubble Sort (largest number bubbles up)
* Insertion sort (insert next number INTO the already sorted half of the list)
* Selection Sort (SELECT the next smallest number from the already sorted half)

USE CS50 resources from Tommy's videos to 

1. Read and follow/trace the sorting algorithms (big picture)
2. Learn the different psuedocode used from Tommy un the videos to
3. Convert the psuedocode INTO a Java solution of three methods as outlined in class and in the Github Repo.
4. Link to Github repo - https://classroom.github.com/a/53JOs6VI 

# Submission
* 10 pts each for each sorting algorithm method (coding, comments, functionality, accuracy)
* 5 pts for Working interaction with the tester class
* Your solution should run in with the Tester class provided.

DO NOT MODIFY THE TESTER CLASS, instead, ensure your SortingAlgorithms.java class will run effectively on the tester.
